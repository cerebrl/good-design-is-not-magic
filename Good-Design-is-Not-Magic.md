# Good Design Is Not Magic

Most people outside of the design community picture creatives somehow conjuring up good design like it’s magic. We sit in front of a blank Photoshop canvas, plug-in to the "ether", and all of a sudden visions come to us as if we have connected to some higher power, porting creativity from the heavens as we wield the mouse pointer across the screen.

This could not be further from the truth for the majority of what is created. Good design is not magic. Good design can be learned if you are willing to educate yourself on the science of what makes things beautiful and attractive to others. As we learn more and more about the human mind, we find out that nearly all humans[1] find certain fundamental properties of objects and their relationship with each other necessary for it to be pleasurable when we view or interact with it.

Please remember, this is not a how to become a good artist, but how to become a good designer. Remember, design is a subset of art; so it inherits the global aspects of art, but also follows its own principles. Pure-art, as we will call it, is entirely subjective and mainly for the sake of the aesthetic. Design is something quite different.

Design is functional art; art with an intent to clearly communicate or function in some kind of meaningful way (of course, with a little panache too). This is what separates it from pure-art. Pure-art commonly fails to communicate to the majority of those that see or interact with it, and that is perfectly fine. But, design does not have that luxury; it fails if only a minority of those that see it or interact with it do not understand its purpose or message.

So, if a designer’s ultimate priority is to communicate, you have to learn the language of visual communication, and like any other language, it has rules of syntax and grammar. Throughout this book, we will cover the common vocabulary you’ll need to know, interject the principals and rationales, move to the syntax and utilize some very simple examples to ensure understanding.

By the end of this book, I’ll prove to you that design is not magic and that all it takes is basic knowledge of how to speak without words. With a strong gasp of these basic principals, you’ll be designing functional, usable art in no time.

## Chapter One: Vocabulary

What follows is far from a definitive, design reference but what's included here is what I would consider "the basics". Here they are in list format:

- Typography
- Spacing
- Balance
- Contrast
- Hierarchy
- Dominance
- Content

I will break each one of these vocabulary words into very simple and understandable bits. I will include the official design principles, and at times current neuroscience, that supports the topic.

### Typography

I am not going to cover much about typography here as it is beyond the scope of this book, but I wanted to mention it as it is arguably one the most vital aspects of design.  Even though most would consider design to be about the creation of the graphic elements of the page, it's the message that is the most vital.

If it wasn't for the message, you would have no reason to design. Since the message is almost always textual, typography is where you should start.

Designers of all levels often make the mistake of starting a design project with imagining the graphics, photos, textures and colors (aka accessory elements) of the product. This is designing from the outside-in and is a ineffective process.

What's better is to design from the inside-out. Start with the message/content; give it some life through good typographic design only, maybe even wireframe it (nothing but lines and text). Once you see something form up, then start adding color and the rest of the accessory elements.

You might actually find yourself doing less design in the long-run. This is caused by having strong content design as it is no longer relying on the crutch that is accessory elements.

If you would like to learn more about basic typography, I will be producing a book to cover this topic in the future. Make sure to keep your eye out for it!

### Spacing

Spacing, is another vital component of design. Let me give you an example:

> HereyouwillfindthatIhaveusednospacing.
> Areyouhavingtroublereadingthismessage?

The above paragraph is an example of no spacing. This, of course, is an extreme example of how important spacing is to communicate a message, but it illustrates the point perfectly. Even when a design requires no text at all, spacing is just as important. There are a couple psychological principles that explain why spacing is so crucial.

First, there is proximity. The rule of proximity dictates that when elements lie closely together, they are perceived to have a relationship or share a commonality. Here's an example of improper spacing:

> Ih avedis rup tedth elett er'spr operp roxim ity.
> I have disrupted the letter's proper proximitey. 

If you found the first sentence very difficult to read (if readable at all), join the club. The reason this sentence is nearly impossible to read is simple. 

The proximity of certain elements to each other communicates that those elements share a common function or purpose (relationsips if you will). These relationships create functional groups. Letters create words, groups of words create headers, paragraphs or footers.

In other words, the letter h in "Ih ave" has a closer proximity to the I. This tells our brain that the h has a stronger relationship with the I than the a-v-e, thus breaking the intended meaning of our message. 

Since design is all about communication, be very thoughtful about how your spacing and proximity is effecting your message. (e.g. Do your navigational elements communicate that they are a functional group that share a common action, or do they look like part of the content body.)

Second, spacing, or more specifically whitespace, increases the signal to noise ratio. The signal being what we want to communicate, and the noise is anything that detracts from the message itself. Here's an example of too many elements:

> This|has|a|lower|signal-to-noise|ratio.
> This has a higher signal-to-noise ratio.

The second sentence is easier to read, but why. That's because it has a high signal to noise ratio. The signal being the letters and the noise being the pipe (|). As obvious as this may be, it is very common for young designers to use a lot of lines, graphics and borders to separate elements on a page. Removing these elements, and using well placed whitespace instead, increases the signal-to-noise ratio and vastly improves the quality of the message.

All good design has a high signal to noise ratio, so don't be afraid to use a generous amount of whitespace around your elements. Now, don't think that all noise is bad. Some noise can add character or a sense of style to a design (think texture, shadows or gradients), but use it sparingly and be subtle. A little goes a long way. 

Third, spacing can influence your emotional state. There is a psychological phenomenon called the Cathedral Effect. This states the there is a relationship between the heigth of a ceiling and the cognition of the observer. The lower the ceiling, the more the observer feels confined, which can trigger a stress response; the higher the ceiling, the more the observer feels free, which can trigger a sense of well-being.

So, by giving the critical content adequate spacing, you give it, and the user, room to breathe. This is important if you want your user to interact with your product as much as possible and more importantly, enjoy the interaction. This can be acheived with a healthy does of space between the main element(s) and the top of the document.

Last but not least, as a designer, you have to be strong, and not give in to the fear of empty space. This is called horror vacui or fear of emptiness. Many people, when given the choice, will fill empty space with stuff. 

This is almost always caused by an insecurity. Whether it's a client not wanting to miss an opportunity to sell something off of their home page, or a designer feeling insecure about her skills, it will, most likely, negatively impact the user's perception of the product.

This inverse relationship between the number of elements in a design and the perceived value can be effective if used correctly. In other words, the more empty space there is in a design, the more valuable the product of service is perceived. Think of the difference between Walmart and Nordstrom's; *both* are by design.


[1] At times, Western and Eastern cultures differ on what they perceive as a "good" interface. This can be seen in the perception of simplicity versus complexity. Some Eastern cultures see complexity as powerful and feature rich; Westerners will more than likely perceive that same interface as busy, bloated or cheap.
